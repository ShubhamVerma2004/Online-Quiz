Here’s a refined workflow based on your requirements, clarifying roles and order processing with Hoseler as the central hub for approvals and deliveries:

Revised Role Definitions & Workflow
1. Admin
Full Control: Manages all databases (User, Hoseler, Retailer, Doctor).

Oversight: Monitors transactions, but Hoseler handles order approvals.

2. Hoseler (Hospital + Seller)
Key Authority:

Adds/Approves Doctors and Retailers in the system.

Receives all order requests from Users/Doctors/Retailers.

Manages medicine delivery (sources from Retailers or own inventory).

Functions:

Approve/Reject orders.

Assign delivery tasks to Retailers or in-house staff.

Update order status for tracking.

3. Doctor
Can Request Orders:

For patients or clinic use (e.g., medicines, equipment).

Requests go to Hoseler (not directly to Retailers).

Limited Access:

Add medical info/posts.

View patient prescriptions (if integrated).

4. Retailer (Medicine Supplier)
No Direct Orders:

Cannot fulfill orders without Hoseler’s approval.

Receives delivery tasks from Hoseler.

Functions:

Update stock in the system.

Confirm deliveries to Hoseler/Users.

5. User (Patients/Customers)
Place Orders:

Requests sent to Hoseler (not Retailer/Doctor).

Track Delivery:

Status updated by Hoseler (e.g., "Approved," "Shipped").

Order Flow Example
User/Doctor submits order → Hoseler reviews.

Hoseler approves → Assigns to:

Retailer (if external stock) OR

In-house inventory (if Hoseler stocks medicine).

Retailer delivers → Confirms to Hoseler → Hoseler marks order complete.

User/Doctor receives delivery notification.

Key Rules
No Direct Transactions:

Doctors/Users cannot contact Retailers directly.

All orders must route via Hoseler.

Hoseler is Gatekeeper:

Controls supply chain (prevents unauthorized sales).

Ensures compliance (e.g., prescription validation).

Suggested Improvements
Approval Alerts: Hoseler gets instant notifications for new orders.

Audit Logs: Track order changes (e.g., if Hoseler modifies requests).

Role-Based UI:

Doctors see "Request Medicine" button (not "Buy").

Retailers see "Fulfill Orders" tab (no pricing controls).

Would you like to add payment handling (e.g., Hoseler collects payment before approving orders)?
